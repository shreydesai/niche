@DuncanVB When you sexually identify as a troll doll and want to audition for My chemical romance
@luisaomielan Yeah but just remember all those kids that got all of their operations thanks to Facebook likes.
@Madi_MacMahon Well at least you made friends. THERE IS ALWAYS AN UPSIDE.
@Madi_MacMahon YOU CAN NEVER TRULY KNOW YOURSELF UNTIL YOU HAVE EATEN AN ENTIRE PACKET OF BISCUITS IN ONE GO

RT @Gendarmerie: #Nice06 Don't propagate rumors and don't broadcast shocking photos or videos
@LittleSyko I don't get it, jumping on hashtags for self gratification can shit off.
I get people want to help, but using the hashtag if you're not directly affected only makes it harder for those trying to use it.
Don't jump on the hashtag for people offering safety for those in Nice, the hashtag should be for those who need it, not those who don't.

@Niall_Slater hahaha! SORRY
@PastelPouts @flendog_ Honestly my favourite part of today.
@flendog_ she's the moment a waiter asks you if you're enjoying your meal just as you have a mouthful of food
@flendog_ she's the moment you smell the person next to you on a bus
@flendog_ she's the moment you get on a plane and your seated next to a crying baby.
@flendog_ she's the panic you feel when you hear a cat being sick but you can't find it
@flendog_ She's the feeling you get when your hand touches some food whilst your doing the washing up.
@flendog_ She's that feeling you get when your sock slides off inside your shoe whilst you're walking
@annabel_lea putting that on my CV

This is the worst series of British politics ever. There's no character progression, the writing is terrible and all the actors are awful.
This is like watching voldemort pick which deatheaters should invade different parts of hogwarts.
@fractalbears meet you there. Bring whiskey.
Looking forward to Boris Johnson's first visit to bongo bongo land.

Cameron's last day in office. The Tory party have done a quick whip round of what was in their pockets so there is £17million in his card

PREVIOUSLY ON BRITISH POLITICS: everything was all sorts of fucked up and everyone ran away AND NOW THIS WEEK'S SHOW *muffled screaming*
Andrea Leadsom stands at the podium. She takes a deep breath. "I CANNOT BE STOPPED" she screams as she throws babies at journalists.
The Tory party motto at the moment: "This seems like a lot of hard work so fuck it"
